# Drop See

The app allows you to view images from the Flickr API. Double tap anywhere on the map and a pin will appear. Then a collection view will display 40 images and you can slide down to hide it or tap to place a new pin for new pictures. You can also click on an image to view it in full screen. The app will ask for user location and by pressing the bottom right arrow button, it will re-center to your current location. Used Alamofire and AlamofireImage to download and present from the API.

Created with Xcode 9 Beta.
